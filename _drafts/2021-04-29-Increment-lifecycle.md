## How work enters and exits the scrum framework
One of the most delicate and easy to break rhythms in scrum is how work enters and exits the process.  You spend too much time grooming cards which strangles the scrum team from lack of ready stories or the scrum team works through stories faster than you can groom them which leads to idle time or _more commonly_ scrum teams pulling in under-groomed work which leads to changing acceptance critera mid-sprint / rework / bugs / etc.
