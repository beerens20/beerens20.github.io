API Keys are used so the provider can track your usage and gate certain information.\
* Keys are generated by the API provider and need to be included in the API call for SOME calls

Sensitive keys should be stored as environment variables
* In the console type ```export {name of the variable}={password or api key}```
* Need to (in python) import the os module
* In the authentication key variable use the environment variable you just created
```python
import os

api_key = os.environ.get(env-variable-name)
```
